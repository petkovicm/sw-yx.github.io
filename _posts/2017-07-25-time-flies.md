time is flying and it is almost the end of july and another 2 week block. I have slipped in some of my goals. I never got started with the buffer clone and the shirt idea has basically started taking up a lot of time. I will also be fairly busy this weekend moving out of my apartment.

However the podcast is doing better than expected and I am determined to see it through.

i should also try to contact the uber dude (Kobe).

meta and proxima look good. font is a beautiful group of letters i/o a group of beautiful letters.
