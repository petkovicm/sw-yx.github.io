Ok time to polish up and deploy this sumbitch. Today's tasks:

- prettify the stats output with some charting
- deploy (maybe heroku)

i prettified the stats but had some trouble with the tweet this buton which is surprisingly not so obvious when in react. I looked around and it seems <https://github.com/olahol/react-social> is the best method although the display isn't that great.
