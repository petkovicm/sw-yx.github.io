in a massive sprint to 6am last night I finished workproject 2, hosted at <http://sentieoblinkvue.firebaseapp.com>. The stack is basically firebase and vue and it is amazing how intuitive vue is. I even did my first transition work, basically bringing a form of the old html <blink> tag back.

Today I will work on the last requests in VEMB and wash my hands off that project which I have basically lost interest in.
