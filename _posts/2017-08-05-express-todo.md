today i took one of the FSA checkpoint projects and ran a little bit with it. the task was to make a backend todo app and so my personal challenge was to add a frontend. i describe the process a little here <https://github.com/sw-yx/fsa-checkpoint-express> and the final result is hosted here <https://swyx-expresstodo.herokuapp.com/>.

i also spoke with mark davis today about the fullstack fund. i will have to narrow down my focus to somethign i am truly passionate about and that is not teaching.

i am keen on completing more things with the buffer clone as that seems to be progressing well. i will have to start looking into react native and chrome extensions soon.
