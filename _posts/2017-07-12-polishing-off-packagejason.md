1am. time to do the last feature, which is an open eval api, before i can upload and get it hosted. i spent yesterday refactoring the edit page and that sucked but it is more or less done now. Now I have to:

- get it on the index page
- prettify
- set up a public unauthenticated route to take any boilerplate
