So we ended up doing `sqlite3` today and I enjoyed making this: https://github.com/sw-yx/FSA-imdb-roulette

But ultimately it isnt hostable and isn't portfolio quality and so i will stop there.

Instead the buffer clone project is coming front of mind now I have had a chance to refamiliarize with raw node projects.
